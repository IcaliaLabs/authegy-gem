# Icalia A2 gem

The Icalia "A2" gem (which stands for "Authentication & Authorization") is a
library that combines several useful ruby libraries to provide an opinionated
auth structure for your rails apps.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'authegy'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install authegy

## Usage

### Basic Use Case: The User & Role models

- Use only a single "User" class, with several roles associated to it - instead
  of having multiple "user" classes, which tend to have duplicated code &
  functionality between them.
- Roles can also be optionally associated to different "Resource" models, so we
  can limit the authorization to certain objects. Examples:
  - "User 2" is an "Administrator" of "Website 2" (so he/she can change the
    Website 2's URL)
  - "User 3" is a "Procurement Manager" of "Company 4" (so he/she can place
    orders on behalf of the Company 4)
